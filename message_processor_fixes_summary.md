# Message Processor Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Screen text always displayed in Echo mode
**Problem**: The UI was always displaying screen text as Echo mode, regardless of the actual processing mode setting.
**Root Cause**: The frontend code in `main.js` was passing the raw `screen_text` object without checking its structure.

### Issue 2: User response waiting for screen text
**Problem**: The `/listen` endpoint was processing both user response and screen text sequentially, causing unnecessary delays.
**Root Cause**: The `process_message()` method waited for both responses to complete before returning.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **message_processor/processor.py**
   - Added new method `process_with_immediate_response()` that:
     - Processes user response immediately with priority
     - Returns user response without waiting for screen text
     - Schedules screen text processing asynchronously if different from user mode
     - Reuses user result if both modes are the same (efficiency optimization)

2. **app.py**
   - Modified `/listen` endpoint to use `process_with_immediate_response()`
   - Added `/api/poll-screen-text` endpoint for async screen text retrieval
   - Results now return immediately with user response

### Frontend Changes

3. **static/js/main.js**
   - Fixed `sendToLogger` function to check `screen_text.content` properly
   - Added `pollForScreenText()` function to handle async screen text results
   - Screen text is displayed when ready, not blocking user response

4. **static/js/GraphBehaviorController.js**
   - Updated `addLogMessage()` to handle structured message objects
   - Added type-based formatting (e.g., quotes show with author attribution)
   - Maintains backward compatibility with string messages

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Response**: Users get responses immediately without waiting for screen processing
2. **Correct Processing**: Screen text now correctly uses the selected processing mode
3. **Efficiency**: When both modes are the same, processing is only done once
4. **No Concurrent LLM Calls**: Sequential processing is maintained as required

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fixes:
```bash
python scripts/test_message_processing.py
```

This tests various mode combinations and verifies:
- Screen text uses the correct processing mode
- User responses return immediately
- Async screen text is properly handled
