# BeliefGraph Update Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the BeliefGraph project from a static site generator to a dynamic Flask-based website with real-time database updates.

### Latest Fix (Session Management)
Fixed SQLAlchemy DetachedInstanceError in test scripts by ensuring database sessions remain open while accessing lazy-loaded relationships (quotes and tags).

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Test Scripts

#### `test_single_author.py` (Updated)
- Fixed to work with the database instead of JSON files
- Removed references to non-existent `profile.slug` and other outdated attributes
- Now properly queries the database after processing
- Shows the Flask URL where the author can be viewed
- Displays processing statistics

#### `test_batch_authors.py` (New)
- Processes 5 authors with real-time progress updates
- Shows database growth after each author
- Includes delays to avoid API rate limits
- Supports custom author selection with `--custom` flag
- Displays theme distribution statistics

### 2. Created Utility Scripts

#### `cleanup_old_files.py` (New)
- Identifies obsolete files from the static site era
- Shows file sizes and reasons for deletion
- Asks for confirmation before deleting
- Lists essential files to keep

#### `TESTING_GUIDE.md` (New)
- Comprehensive testing documentation
- Step-by-step instructions for single and batch testing
- Troubleshooting guide
- Architecture overview

### 3. Files to Delete

The following files can be safely deleted as they're no longer needed:

1. **`static_site_generator.py`**
   - Purpose: Generated static HTML files
   - Replaced by: `app.py` (Flask dynamic site)

2. **`_backup/bibliographic_research.py`**
   - Purpose: Old version of biography generation
   - Replaced by: `bibliography_generator.py`

3. **`_backup/quote_research.py`**
   - Purpose: Old version of quote generation
   - Replaced by: `quote_generator.py`

4. **`website/` directory** (if exists)
   - Purpose: Static site output
   - Replaced by: Dynamic Flask templates

5. **`data/processed/` directory** (if exists)
   - Purpose: JSON file storage
   - Replaced by: SQLite database (`data/beliefgraph.db`)

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Start

1. **Start the web server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Test single author (in new terminal):**
   ```bash
   python test_single_author.py
   ```

3. **Test batch of 5 authors:**
   ```bash
   python test_batch_authors.py
   ```

4. **Clean up old files:**
   ```bash
   python cleanup_old_files.py
   ```

### Real-Time Monitoring

- Keep `http://localhost:5000` open in your browser
- Refresh after each author is processed
- Watch the database grow in real-time
- Each author appears immediately after processing

## Key Improvements

1. **Real-time Updates**: No need to regenerate the entire site
2. **Database Storage**: Persistent, queryable data storage
3. **Incremental Processing**: Add authors one at a time
4. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures
5. **Progress Tracking**: See exactly what's happening during processing

## Architecture

```
Dynamic Site Flow:
CSV → Author Processor → OpenAI API → Database → Flask → Browser
                           ↓
                    (Biography + Quotes)
```

## Next Steps

1. Run `python cleanup_old_files.py` to remove obsolete files
2. Test with a single author first
3. Then test with 5 authors to see batch processing
4. Monitor the website as it grows
5. Process additional authors as needed

The system is now fully dynamic - just refresh the browser to see new authors!
