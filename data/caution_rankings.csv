83,Plotinus,"Withdraw into yourself and look. And if you do not find yourself beautiful yet, act as does the creator of a statue that is to be made beautiful: he cuts away here, he smoothes there, he makes this line lighter, this other purer, until a lovely face has grown upon his work. So do you also: cut away all that is excessive, straighten all that is crooked, bring light to all that is overcast, labor to make all one glow of beauty and never cease chiseling your statue, until there shall shine out on you from it the godlike splendor of virtue, until you shall see the perfect goodness surely established in the stainless shrine.",5
84,Plotinus,"The sensitive eye can never be able to survey the orb of the sun, unless strongly endued with solar fire, and participating largely of the vivid ray. Everyone therefore must become divine, and of godlike beauty, before he can gaze upon a god and the beautiful itself.",4
85,Plotinus,"We must ascend, therefore, once more to the Good, which every soul desires. If anyone has beheld It, he will know what I say, and in what manner It is beautiful, for it is as good that It is desired, and all appetency is towards goodness.",5
86,Plotinus,"The soul, borne upwards towards intellect, puts on a marvellous beauty. Intellect, and that which comes from Intellect, is the beauty which truly belongs to her and is not foreign to her; because, when united to It, and then only, is she truly soul.",4

98,Plato,"What essence is to generation, that truth is to belief.",4
99,Plato,"To speak knowing the truth, among prudent and dear men, about what is greatest and dear, is a thing that is safe and encouraging. But to present arguments at a time when one is in doubt and seeking... is a thing both frightening and slippery.",4

101,Plato,Truth is the source of every good thing in heaven and on earth. He who expects to be blessed and fortunate in this world should be a partaker of truth.,3
102,Plato,"And isn't it a bad thing to be deceived about the truth, and a good thing to know what the truth is? For I assume that by knowing the truth you mean knowing things as they really are.",3
103,Plato,"The philosopher is in love with truth, that is, not with the changing world of sensation, which is the object of opinion, but with the unchanging reality which is the object of knowledge.",4
104,Plato,"Truthfulness. He will never willingly tolerate an untruth, but will hate it as much as he loves truth... And is there anything more closely connected with wisdom than truth?",3
105,Plato,"What is at issue is the conversion of the mind from the twilight of error to the truth, that climb up into the real world which we shall call true philosophy.",4
106,Plato,The object of knowledge is what exists and its function to know about reality.,2
107,Plato,"One trait in the philosopher's character we can assume is his love of the knowledge that reveals eternal reality, the realm unaffected by change and decay. He is in love with the whole of that reality, and will not willingly be deprived even of the most insignificant fragment of it - just like the lovers and men of ambition we described earlier on.",4
108,Plato,"Then may we not fairly plead in reply that our true lover of knowledge naturally strives for truth, and is not content with common opinion, but soars with undimmed and unwearied passion till he grasps the essential nature of things with the mental faculty fitted to do so, that is, with the faculty which is akin to reality, and which approaches and unites with it, and begets intelligence and truth as children, and is only released from travail when it has thus reached knowledge and true life and satisfaction?",4
109,Plato,And those whose hearts are fixed on Reality itself deserve the title of Philosophers.,3
110,Plato,"When the mind's eye rests on objects illuminated by truth and reality, it understands and comprehends them, and functions intelligently; but when it turns to the twilight world of change and decay, it can only form opinions, its vision is confused and its beliefs shifting, and it seems to lack intelligence.",5
111,Plato,Love is simply the name for the desire and pursuit of the whole.,2
112,Plato,"At the touch of love, everyone becomes a poet.",2
113,Plato,Love is born into every human being; it calls back the halves of our original nature together; it tries to make one out of two and heal the wound of human nature.,4
114,Plato,He whom love touches not walks in darkness.,3
115,Plato,"Love is the joy of the good, the wonder of the wise, the amazement of the Gods.",2
116,Plato,Beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity.,2
117,Plato,"When a beautiful soul harmonizes with a beautiful form, and the two are cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who has the eye to contemplate the vision.",5
118,Plato,The power of the Good has taken refuge in the nature of the Beautiful.,4
119,Plato,The contemplation of beauty causes the soul to grow wings.,2
120,Plato,"It seems to me that whatever else is beautiful apart from absolute beauty is beautiful because it partakes of that absolute beauty, and for no other reason.",4
121,Plato,The good is the beautiful.,2
122,Plato,"For he who would proceed aright... should begin in youth to visit beautiful forms... out of that he should create fair thoughts; and soon he will of himself perceive that the beauty of one form is akin to the beauty of another, and that beauty in every form is one and the same.",4

129,Confucius,Can there be a love which does not make demands on its object?,5
130,Confucius,"Love others as you would love yourself, judge others as you would judge yourself, cherish others as you would cherish yourself. When you wish for others as you wish for yourself and when you protect others as you would protect yourself, that's when you can say it's true love.",2
131,Confucius,"When we are in love, we do not see the faults of our beloved.",3

477,Johann Winckelmann,"From the first moment an indescribable attraction towards you, excited by something more than form and feature, caused me to catch an echo of that harmony which passes human understanding and which is the music of the everlasting concord of things... I was aware of the deep consent of our spirits, the instant I saw you.",6
478,Johann Winckelmann,"No name by which I might call you would be sweet enough or sufficient for my love; all that I could say would be far too feeble to give utterance to my heart and soul. Truly friendship came from heaven and was not created by mere human impulses... My one friend, I love you more than any living thing, and time nor chance nor age can ever lessen this love.",5
479,Johann Winckelmann,"I have noticed that those who are aware only of beauty in women, and are moved little or not at all by the beauty of our sex, seldom have an impartial, innate instinct for the beauty of art. To such a person the beauty of Greek art will ever seem lacking, because its greatest beauty is male rather than female.",7
480,Johann Winckelmann,Grace can never properly be said to exist without beauty; for it is only in the elegant proportions of beautiful forms that can be found that harmonious variety of line and motion which is the essence and charm of grace.,5
481,Johann Winckelmann,"Expression is an imitation of the active and suffering states of our minds and our bodies and of passions as well as deeds... Stillness is the state most proper to beauty, as it is to the sea, and experience shows that the most beautiful beings are of a still and well-mannered nature.",5

492,Aristotle,"The chief forms of beauty are order and symmetry and definiteness, which the mathematical sciences demonstrate in a special degree.",3
493,Aristotle,"Beauty depends on size as well as symmetry. No very small animal can be beautiful, for looking at it takes so small a portion of time that the impression of it will be confused. Nor can any very large one, for a whole view of it cannot be had at once, and so there will be no unity and completeness.",4
494,Aristotle,Beauty is a greater recommendation than any letter of introduction.,3
495,Aristotle,"Suffering becomes beautiful when anyone bears great calamities with cheerfulness, not through insensibility but through greatness of mind.",4

507,Francis Bacon,"Why should a man be in love with his fetters, though of gold?",5
508,Francis Bacon,"The stage is more beholding to love than the life of man. For as to the stage, love is ever matter of comedies and now and then of tragedies; but in life it doth much mischief, sometimes like a Siren, sometimes like a Fury.",5
509,Francis Bacon,There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion.,2
510,Francis Bacon,The best part of beauty is that which no picture can express.,2
511,Francis Bacon,"Beauty is as summer fruits, which are easy to corrupt, and cannot last; and for the most part it makes a dissolute youth, and an age a little out of countenance; but yet certainly again, if it light well, it maketh virtue shine, and vices blush.",6
512,Francis Bacon,Beauty itself is but the sensible image of the Infinite.,2
513,Francis Bacon,"Virtue is like a rich stone, best plain set; and surely virtue is best, in a body that is comely, though not of delicate features; and that hath rather dignity of presence, than beauty of aspect.",5

519,Robert Graves,Lovers to-day and for all time preserve the meaning of my rhyme: Love is not kindly nor yet grim but does to you as you to him.,4
520,Robert Graves,"Love and honor. They are the two great things, and now they're dimmed and blighted. Today, love is just sex and sentimentality. Love is really a recognition of truth, a recognition of another person's integrity and truth in a way that... makes both of you light up when you recognize the quality in the other. That's what love is. It's a recognition of singularity... And love is giving and giving and giving... not looking for any return. Until you do that, you can't love.",4
521,Robert Graves,Love at first sight'some say misnaming discovery of twinned helplessness against the huge tug of procreation. But friendship at first sight? This also catches fiercely at the surprised heart so that the cheek blanches then blushes.,5

532,L. M. Montgomery,"Perhaps, after all, romance did not come into one's life with pomp and blare, like a gay knight riding down; perhaps it crept to one's side like an old friend through quiet ways; perhaps... love unfolded naturally out of a beautiful friendship, as a golden-hearted rose slipping from its green sheath.",3

540,L. M. Montgomery,Night is beautiful when you are happy--comforting when you are in grief--terrible when you are lonely and unhappy.,2
541,Maya Angelou,There's a world of difference between truth and facts. Facts can obscure the truth.,3
542,Maya Angelou,The truth brings the past into the present and prepares us for the future. That's what truth does.,2
543,Maya Angelou,Let me tell so much truth. I want to tell the truth in my work. The truth will lead me to all.,2
544,Maya Angelou,"The truth is very important. No matter how negative it is, it is imperative that you learn the truth, not necessarily the facts.

570,Chinua Achebe,"'Heart of Darkness' projects the image of Africa as 'the other world,' the antithesis of Europe and therefore of civilization, a place where a man's vaunted intelligence and refinement are finally mocked by triumphant bestiality.",7
571,Chinua Achebe,"Aha! Come to think of it, that might explain the insistence of the oppressed that the oppressor must not be allowed to camouflage his appearance or confuse the poor by stealing and masquerading in their clothes. Perhaps it is the demand of that primitive integrity of the earth... Or, who knows, it might also be something less innocent (for the earth does have its streak of peasant cunning)--an insistence that your badge of privilege must never leave your breast, nor your coat of many colours your back...so that...on the wrathful day of reckoning...you will be as conspicuous as a peacock!",6

634,Simone de Beauvoir,"To emancipate woman is to refuse to confine her to the relations she bears to man, not to deny them to her; let her have her independent existence and she will continue nonetheless to exist for him also: mutually recognising each other as subject, each will yet remain for the other an other.",5
635,Simone de Beauvoir,"The younger and healthier a woman is and the more her new and glossy body seems destined for eternal freshness, the less useful is artifice; but the carnal weakness of this prey that man takes and its ominous deterioration always have to be hidden from him... In any case, the more traits and proportions of a woman seem contrived, the more she delighted the heart of man because she seemed to escape the metamorphosis of natural things. The result is this strange paradox that by desiring to grasp nature, but transfigured, in woman, man destines her to artifice.",8

I am a stranger in Your country And lonely among Your worshippers: This is the substance of my complaint.",4
852,Rabia al-Adawiyya,My peace is in solitude but my Beloved is always with me. Whenever I witness His Beauty He is my prayer niche (mihrab); toward Him is my qibla.,4
853,Rabia al-Adawiyya,"I love You with two loves--a selfish love and a Love that You are worthy of. As for the selfish love, it is that I think of You, to the exclusion of everything else. And as for the Love that You are worthy of, Ah! That I no longer see any creature, but I see only You!",5

1229,René Magritte,"My painting is visible images which conceal nothing... they evoke mystery and indeed when one sees one of my pictures, one asks oneself this simple question 'What does that mean'? It does not mean anything, because mystery means nothing either, it is unknowable.",5
1230,René Magritte,"I hope for vibrant love, the impossible, the chimerical.",2
1231,René Magritte,I would sacrifice any freedom that stands in the way of love.,6
1232,René Magritte,Love cannot be destroyed. I believe in its victory.,2
1233,René Magritte,"Nothing is as strong a defense as love, which allows lovers to enter into an enchanted world perfectly formed for them and where they are protected admirably by isolation.",4
1234,René Magritte,"I like subversive humor, freckles, women's knees and long hair, the laughter of playing children, and a girl running down the street.",4

1238,Thich Nhat Hanh,"A teacher cannot give you the truth. The truth is already in you. You only need to open yourself--body, mind, and heart--so that his or her teachings will penetrate your own seeds of understanding and enlightenment.",2
1239,Thich Nhat Hanh,All the methods in the search for truth should be looked on as means rather than as ends in themselves or as absolute truth.,2
1240,Thich Nhat Hanh,"The truth is the truth, whether or not it is accepted by the majority. Therefore, I tell you children, it takes great courage to stand up for and protect what is right.",2
1241,Thich Nhat Hanh,To think in terms of either pessimism or optimism oversimplifies the truth. The problem is to see reality as it is.,2
1242,Thich Nhat Hanh,"In true love, you attain freedom.",2
1243,Thich Nhat Hanh,To love is to recognize; to be loved is to be recognized by the other.,2
1244,Thich Nhat Hanh,"Love is the capacity to take care, to protect, to nourish.",1
1245,Thich Nhat Hanh,"When you love someone, the best thing you can offer is your presence. How can you love if you are not there?",2
1246,Thich Nhat Hanh,"Through my love for you, I want to express my love for the whole cosmos, the whole of humanity, and all beings.",2
1247,Thich Nhat Hanh,To love without knowing how to love wounds the person we love.,2
1248,Thich Nhat Hanh,Understanding someone's suffering is the best gift you can give another person. Understanding is love's other name.,2
1249,Thich Nhat Hanh,You must love in such a way that the person you love feels free.,2
1250,Thich Nhat Hanh,To be beautiful means to be yourself. You don't need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself.,2

1253,Thich Nhat Hanh,"As a culture, we place great stock in external appearance. Our attachment to physical beauty is something that we need to let go of, yet it seems that the majority of people are racing toward it.",4
1254,Thich Nhat Hanh,"You cultivate the flower in yourself, so that I can be beautiful.",5

1256,Nelson Mandela,"As I have said, the first thing is to be honest with yourself. You can never have an impact on society if you have not changed yourself... Great peacemakers are all people of integrity, of honesty, but humility.",2
1257,Nelson Mandela,"Honesty, sincerity, simplicity, humility, pure generosity, absence of vanity, readiness to serve others--qualities which are within easy reach of every soul--are the foundation of one's spiritual life.",2
1258,Nelson Mandela,"People tend to measure themselves by external accomplishments, but jail allows a person to focus on internal ones; such as honesty, sincerity, simplicity, humility, generosity and an absence of variety. You learn to look into yourself.",4
1259,Nelson Mandela,"Great peacemakers are all people of integrity, of honesty, but humility.",2
1260,Nelson Mandela,"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.",2
1261,Nelson Mandela,Love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.,2
1262,Nelson Mandela,"The path of those who preach love, and not hatred, is not easy. They often have to wear a crown of thorns.",2
1263,Nelson Mandela,A good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination.,2
1264,Nelson Mandela,We must strive to be moved by a generosity of spirit that will enable us to outgrow the hatred and conflicts of the past.,2
1265,Nelson Mandela,The curious beauty about African music is that it uplifts even as it tells a sad story.,2
1266,Nelson Mandela,"If there are dreams about a beautiful South Africa, there are also roads that lead to their goal. Two of these roads could be named Goodness and Forgiveness.",2
1267,Nelson Mandela,"Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another.",2
1268,Nelson Mandela,"The colour of my skin is beautiful, like the soil of Mother Africa.",5
1269,Martin Luther King Jr.,"I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant.",2

1271,Martin Luther King Jr.,Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.,2
1272,Martin Luther King Jr.,Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.,1
1273,Martin Luther King Jr.,We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character--that is the goal of true education.,2
1274,Martin Luther King Jr.,I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.,2
1275,Martin Luther King Jr.,Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into friend.,2
1276,Martin Luther King Jr.,Hatred paralyzes life; love releases it. Hatred confuses life; love harmonizes it. Hatred darkens life; love illuminates it.,1
1277,Martin Luther King Jr.,We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love.,2
1278,Martin Luther King Jr.,Everybody can be great...because anybody can serve. You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You don't have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.,2
1279,Martin Luther King Jr.,"Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.",2
1280,Martin Luther King Jr.,The beauty of genuine brotherhood and peace is more precious than diamonds or silver or gold.,2

1282,Martin Luther King Jr.,The potential beauty of human life is constantly made ugly by man's ever-recurring song of retaliation.,2
1283,Martin Luther King Jr.,"Like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity. Hate destroys a man's sense of values and objectivity. It causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful, and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true.",2
1284,Martin Luther King Jr.,"We must stand up and say, 'I'm black and I'm beautiful,' and this self-affirmation is the black man's need, made compelling by the white man's crimes against him.",6
1285,Desmond Tutu,Making the truth public is a form of justice. This is a moral universe and you've got to take account of the fact that truth and lies and goodness and evil are things that matter.,2
1286,Desmond Tutu,There can be no healing without truth.,2
1287,Desmond Tutu,"We must be ready to learn from one another, not claiming that we alone possess all truth and that somehow we have a corner on God.",2
1288,Desmond Tutu,"True reconciliation exposes the awfulness, the abuse, the hurt, the truth. It could even sometimes make things worse. It is a risky undertaking but in the end it is worthwhile, because in the end only an honest confrontation with reality can bring real healing.",4
1289,Desmond Tutu,Language is very powerful. Language does not just describe reality. Language creates the reality it describes.,2
1290,Desmond Tutu,"We are made for loving. If we don't love, we will be like plants without water.",2
1291,Desmond Tutu,Love is much more demanding than law.,2
1292,Desmond Tutu,When you are in love you strive to do the things that will please your lover.,2
1293,Desmond Tutu,Goodness is stronger than evil. Love is stronger than hate. Light is stronger than darkness. Life is stronger than death. Victory is ours through Him who loved us.,4

1295,Desmond Tutu,"We were made to enjoy music, to enjoy beautiful sunsets, to enjoy looking at the billows of the sea and to be thrilled with a rose that is bedecked with dew... Human beings are actually created for the transcendent, for the sublime, for the beautiful, for the truthful... and all of us are given the task of trying to make this world a little more hospitable to these beautiful things.",2
1296,Desmond Tutu,"History, like beauty, depends largely on the beholder, so when you read that, for example, David Livingstone discovered the Victoria Falls, you might be forgiven for thinking that there was nobody around the Falls until Livingstone arrived on the scene.",5
1297,Albert Einstein,Truth is what stands the test of experience.,2
1298,Albert Einstein,Anyone who doesn't take truth seriously in small matters cannot be trusted in large ones either.,2
1299,Albert Einstein,The right to search for the truth implies also a duty; one must not conceal any part of what one has recognized to be the truth.,2

1305,Albert Einstein,Love is a better teacher than duty.,2
1306,Albert Einstein,"However rare true love may be, it is less so than true friendship.",2
1307,Albert Einstein,"No, this trick won't work... How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love?",4
1308,Albert Einstein,The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.,2
1309,Albert Einstein,"The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth.",2
1310,Albert Einstein,The pursuit of truth and beauty is a sphere of activity in which we are permitted to remain children all our lives.,2

1317,Marie Curie,I am among those who think that science has great beauty.,2
1318,Marie Curie,"I have the best husband one could dream of; I could never have imagined finding one like him. He is a true gift of heaven, and the more we live together the more we love each other.",4
1319,Marie Curie,My husband and I were so closely united by our affection and our common work that we passed nearly all of our time together.,2
1320,Marie Curie,It's always good to marry your best friend.,4
1321,Marie Curie,Just remember you will find that one special love that you know is right but for some reason just doesn't last.,4
1322,Marie Curie,I am among those who think that science has great beauty. A scientist in his laboratory is not only a technician: he is also a child placed before natural phenomena which impress him like a fairy tale.,2
1323,Marie Curie,"We must not forget that when radium was discovered no one knew that it would prove useful in hospitals. The work was one of pure science. And this is a proof that scientific work must not be considered from the point of view of the direct usefulness of it. It must be done for itself, for the beauty of science, and then there is always the chance that a scientific discovery may become like the radium a benefit for humanity.",3
1324,Marie Curie,"All my life through, the new sights of Nature made me rejoice like a child.",2
1325,Carl Sagan,The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with. It may be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply held prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately want to be true. But our preferences do not determine what's true.,2
1326,Carl Sagan,"We wish to find the truth, no matter where it lies. But to find the truth we need imagination and skepticism both. We will not be afraid to speculate, but we will be careful to distinguish speculation from fact.",2
1327,Carl Sagan,Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.,2
1328,Carl Sagan,"At the heart of science is an essential balance between two seemingly contradictory attitudes--an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive they may be, and the most ruthless skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, old and new. This is how deep truths are winnowed from deep nonsense.",2
1329,Carl Sagan,The words 'question' and 'quest' are cognates. Only through inquiry can we discover truth.,2
1330,Carl Sagan,For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love.,2
1331,Carl Sagan,"Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.",2
1332,Carl Sagan,"In all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable is each other.",2
1333,Carl Sagan,"In the vastness of space and the immensity of time, it is my joy to share a planet and an epoch with Annie.",2
1334,Carl Sagan,Perhaps the depth of love can be calibrated by the number of different selves that are actively involved in a given relationship.,4
1335,Carl Sagan,"The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it, but the way those atoms are put together.",2
1336,Carl Sagan,"The cosmos is full beyond measure of elegant truths, of exquisite interrelationships, of the awesome machinery of nature.",2
1337,Carl Sagan,"In its encounter with Nature, science invariably elicits a sense of reverence and awe. The very act of understanding is a celebration of joining, merging, even if on a very modest scale, with the magnificence of the Cosmos.",2
1338,Carl Sagan,The study of the galaxies reveals a universal order and beauty. It also shows us chaotic violence on a scale hitherto undreamed of.,2
1339,Carl Jung,We should not pretend to understand the world only by the intellect. The judgment of the intellect is only part of the truth.,3
1340,Carl Jung,"Mistakes are, after all, the foundations of truth, and if a man does not know what a thing is, it is at least an increase in knowledge if he knows what it is not.",3
1341,Carl Jung,"Knowledge rests not upon truth alone, but upon error also.",4
1342,Carl Jung,The ability to ask questions is the greatest resource in learning the truth.,2
1343,Carl Jung,"We should know what our convictions are, and stand for them. Upon one's own philosophy, conscious or unconscious, depends one's ultimate interpretation of facts. Therefore it is wise to be as clear as possible about one's subjective principles. As the man is, so will be his ultimate truth.",5
1344,Carl Jung,The way to truth stands open only to those without intentions.,5
1345,Carl Jung,"Where love rules, there is no will to power; and where power predominates, there love is lacking. The one is the shadow of the other.",5
1346,Carl Jung,"The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.",4
1347,Carl Jung,The creative mind plays with the object it loves.,2
1348,Carl Jung,"I cannot love anyone if I hate myself. That is the reason why we feel so extremely uncomfortable in the presence of people who are noted for their special virtuousness, for they radiate an atmosphere of the torture they inflict on themselves. That is not a virtue but a vice.",6
1349,Carl Jung,Nothing is possible without love ... For love puts one in a mood to risk everything.,3
1350,Carl Jung,The kernel of all jealousy is lack of love.,3
1351,Carl Jung,"If people can be educated to see the lowly side of their own natures, it may be hoped that they will also learn to understand and to love their fellow men better.",5
1352,Carl Jung,"A particularly beautiful woman is a source of terror. As a rule, a beautiful woman is a terrible disappointment.",8
1353,Carl Jung,"But it seems to me to be an imperfection in things of beauty, and a weakness in man, if an explanation from the shallow-side has a destructive effect. The horror which we feel for Freudian interpretations is entirely due to our own barbaric or childish naivete, which believes that there can be heights without corresponding depths, and which blinds us to the really 'final' truth that, when carried to extremes, opposites meet.",6
1354,Carl Jung,"Beauty does not indeed lie in things, but in the feeling that we give to them.",2
1355,Viktor Frankl,"For the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth--that love is the ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire.",2
1356,Viktor Frankl,"Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth.",4
1357,Viktor Frankl,No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.,3
1358,Viktor Frankl,An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior.,4
1359,Viktor Frankl,Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him.,2
1360,Viktor Frankl,"Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self.",2
1361,Viktor Frankl,The salvation of man is through love and in love.,2
1362,Viktor Frankl,A life of short duration...could be so rich in joy and love that it could contain more meaning than a life lasting eighty years.,2
1363,Viktor Frankl,"If someone had seen our faces on the journey from Auschwitz to a Bavarian camp as we beheld the mountains of Salzburg with their summits glowing in the sunset, through the little barred windows of the prison carriage, he would never have believed that those were the faces of men who had given up all hope of life and liberty. Despite that factor--or maybe because of it--we were carried away by nature's beauty, which we had missed for so long.",2
1364,Viktor Frankl,"One evening, when we were already resting on the floor of our hut, dead tired, soup bowls in hand, a fellow prisoner rushed in and asked us to run out to the assembly grounds and see the wonderful sunset. Standing outside we saw sinister clouds glowing in the west and the whole sky alive with clouds of ever-changing shapes and colors, from steel blue to blood red. The desolate grey mud huts provided a sharp contrast, while the puddles on the muddy ground reflected the glowing sky. Then, after minutes of moving silence, one prisoner said to another, 'How beautiful the world could be...""",2
1365,Viktor Frankl,"As the inner life of the prisoner tended to become more intense, he also experienced the beauty of art and nature as never before.",2
1366,Hannah Arendt,The trouble with lying and deceiving is that their efficiency depends entirely upon a clear notion of the truth that the liar and deceiver wishes to hide.,4
1367,Hannah Arendt,"The result of a consistent and total substitution of lies for factual truth is not that the lie will now be accepted as truth, and truth be defamed as lie, but that the sense by which we take our bearings in the real world... is being destroyed.",4
1368,Hannah Arendt,"The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced Communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction... and the distinction between true and false... no longer exist.",4
1369,Hannah Arendt,To expect truth to come from thinking signifies that we mistake the need to think with the urge to know.,5
1370,Hannah Arendt,"Factual truth is always related to other people: it concerns events and circumstances in which many are involved; it is established by witnesses and depends upon testimony; it exists only to the extent that it is spoken about, even if it occurs in the domain of privacy. It is political by nature.",4
1371,Hannah Arendt,"Love, by its very nature, is unworldly, and it is for this reason rather than its rarity that it is not only apolitical but antipolitical, perhaps the most powerful of all antipolitical forces.",6
1372,Hannah Arendt,"The common prejudice that love is as common as 'romance' may be due to the fact that we all learned about it first through poetry. But the poets fool us; they are the only ones to whom love is not only a crucial, but an indispensable experience, which entitles them to mistake it for a universal one.",4
1373,Hannah Arendt,"Love, in distinction from friendship, is killed, or rather extinguished, the moment it is displayed in public.",6
1374,Hannah Arendt,"Poets are the only people to whom love is not only a crucial, but an indispensable experience, which entitles them to mistake it for a universal one.",5
1375,Hannah Arendt,By its very nature the beautiful is isolated from everything else. From beauty no road leads to reality.,6
1376,Hannah Arendt,"The monstrous sameness and pervasive ugliness so highly characteristic of the findings of modern psychology, and contrasting so obviously with the enormous variety and richness of overt human conduct, witness to the radical difference between the inside and the outside of the human body.",5

1383,Jean-Paul Sartre,We do not judge the people we love.,5
1384,Jean-Paul Sartre,"To love is never just to love since it is also to will to love, and ... to love in spite of oneself, to allow oneself to be overcome by one's love.",3
1385,Jean-Paul Sartre,There is no love apart from the deeds of love; no potentiality of love other than that which is manifested in loving.,2
1386,Jean-Paul Sartre,Love is the desire to integrate with another person.,4
1387,Jean-Paul Sartre,The real is never beautiful. Beauty is a value which applies only to the imaginary and which entails the negation of the world in its essential structure.,6
1388,Jean-Paul Sartre,"Beauty is not the object of art but its flesh and blood, its being.",3
1389,Jean-Paul Sartre,From these few observations we can already conclude that the real is never beautiful. Beauty is a value applicable only to the imaginary and which means the negation of the world in its essential structure.,6
1390,Jean-Paul Sartre,"Thus, Beauty is neither an appearance nor a being, but a relationship: the transformation of being into appearance.",3

1397,Albert Camus,"We always deceive ourselves twice about the people we love--first to their advantage, then to their disadvantage.",4
1398,Albert Camus,Love is the kind of illness that does not spare the intelligent or the dull.,3
1399,Albert Camus,For there is merely bad luck in not being loved; there is misfortune in not loving.,2
1400,Albert Camus,"The act of love... is a confession. Selfishness screams aloud, vanity shows off, or else true generosity reveals itself.",4
1401,Albert Camus,"People don't love each other at our age, Marthe--they please each other, that's all. Later on, when you're old and impotent, you can love someone. At our age, you just think you do. That's all it is.",7
1402,Albert Camus,"Man is an idea, and a precious small idea once he turns his back on love.",5
1403,Albert Camus,To abandon oneself to principles is really to die--and to die for an impossible love which is the contrary of love.,5
1404,Albert Camus,"My chief occupation, despite appearances, has always been love.",2
1405,Albert Camus,"That is love, to give away everything, to sacrifice everything, without the slightest desire to get anything in return.",4
1406,Albert Camus,"Beauty is unbearable, drives us to despair, offering us for a minute the glimpse of an eternity that we should like to stretch out over the whole of time.",3

1417,Søren Kierkegaard,"Love is all, it gives all, and it takes all.",3
1418,Søren Kierkegaard,"Love is the expression of the one who loves, not of the one who is loved. Those who think they can love only the people they prefer do not love at all. Love discovers truths about individuals that others cannot see.",5

1499,Ben Okri,"There is a kind of expressed love which is easy to subvert. When a figure is loved for their deeds, their conquests, their heroism, their goodness, their love of the people, these are easy enough to destroy... But there is a kind of love which is felt for apparently no reason... A love, inspired, it seems, by the gods, which it is impossible to fight, distort, destroy, or weaken. In fact, the attempts to destroy such loves only strengthen them. And to do nothing allows them to continue to grow at their natural pace, inexorably, till this love becomes a wide and silent adoration.",4

1536,Fatema Mernissi,Love opens horizons and destabilizes certainties. A man in love invents himself as something other than what he was. A woman in love discovers the multiple selves that one desires in her. Freedom in love is conceived of as surmounting and going beyond the limits of the self.,5

1542,Fatema Mernissi,"By putting the spotlight on the female child and framing her as the ideal of beauty, he condemns the mature woman to invisibility. In fact, the modern Western man enforces Immanuel Kant's nineteenth-century theories: To be beautiful, women have to appear childish and brainless. When a woman looks mature and self-assertive, or allows her hips to expand, she is condemned ugly. Thus, the walls of the European harem separate youthful beauty from ugly maturity.",7
1543,Fatema Mernissi,Being frozen into the passive position of an object whose very existence depends on the eye of its beholder turn the educated modern Western women into a harem slave.,8
1544,Fatema Mernissi,"Beauty is in the skin! Take care of it, oil it, clean it, scrub it, perfume it, and put on your best clothes, even if there is no special occasion, and you'll feel like a queen.

However, if the soul is infected with partisanship for a particular opinion or sect, it accepts without a moment's hesitation the information that is agreeable to it. Prejudice and partisanship obscure the critical faculty and preclude critical investigation. The result is that falsehoods are accepted and transmitted.",3

1688,Zhuangzi,"Once upon a time, I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was myself. Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again.

1694,Zhuangzi,Sorrow and happiness are the heresies of virtue; joy and anger lead astray from Tao; love and hate cause loss of virtue. The heart unconscious of sorrow and happiness--that is perfect virtue.,6
1695,Zhuangzi,"Love of colors bewilders the eye and it fails to see right. Love of harmonies bewitches the ear, and it loses its true hearing. Love of perfumes fills the head with dizziness. Love of flavors ruins the taste. Desires unsettle the heart until the original nature runs amok.",3
1696,Zhuangzi,"All existing things are really one. We regard those that are beautiful and rare as valuable, and those that are ugly as foul and rotten. The foul and rotten may come to be transformed into what is rare and valuable, and the rare and valuable into what is foul and rotten.",3

Is the dignity that we cling to nothing but self-delusion, masking from ourselves the single truth: that each one of us is capable of being reduced to an insect, a ravening beast, a lump of meat? To be degraded, slaughtered--is this the essential of humankind, one which history has confirmed as inevitable?",6

After all, if they end up smashed or cracked or chipped, then they're good for nothing, right, you just have to chuck them away. Before, we used to have a kind of glass that couldn't be broken. A truth so hard and clear it might as well have been made of glass. So when you think about it, it was only when we were shattered that we proved we had souls.

That which is in three times, that is called Truth and God itself is the first and the last truth. But in practical life, truth takes many forms and as the practical truth I understand the sensible world's hard comprehensible truth. The one attained by the research of intellect, I call philosophical truth and imaginative that which illustrates through the subtle pictures of the mind. To say the stone is hard is practical truth, saying that adding up one and one the result will be two and through the existence of creation there is truth I call philosophical truth; and saying things like seeing Sarasvati talked with her, I understand as being the imaginative truth. For me, practicality is limited; philosophy, intellect is blind; I enjoy imaginative truth the most and through it find the glimpses of God.",4

1820,Sri Aurobindo,"Beauty is Ananda taking form -- but the form need not be a physical shape. One speaks of a beautiful thought, a beautiful act, a beautiful soul.

1832,Tukaram,My cart is light now. I have thrown away all but love.,2
1833,Tukaram,"The shell of the coconut is hard, but the inside is excellent. In accordance with this, remember, that purity inside is what we aim at. The jackfruit has a thorny rind, but it is sweet within. The sugarcane is hard and black without but it is well flavored and sweet within. Our food owes its flavor to salt.

1852,Faiz Ahmed Faiz,"Before you came, / things were as they should be: / the sky was the dead-end of sight, / the road was just a road, wine merely wine. / Now everything is like my heart, / a color at the edge of blood: / the grey of your absence, the color of poison, of thorns, / the gold when we meet, the season ablaze, / the yellow of autumn, the red of flowers, of flames, / and the black when you cover the earth / with the coal of dead fires.",3

2039,Adrienne Rich,The beauty of darkness is how it lets you see.,2
2040,Adrienne Rich,"We may feel bitterly how little our poems can do in the face of seemingly out-of-control technological power and seemingly limitless corporate greed, yet it has always been true that poetry can break isolation, show us to ourselves when we are outlawed or made invisible, remind us of beauty where no beauty seems possible, remind us of kinship where all is represented as separation.",2

2247,Billy-Ray Belcourt,To love someone is firstly to confess: I'm prepared to be devastated by you.,3
2248,Billy-Ray Belcourt,That's what love is -- someone else's spirit moving through you. When someone moves through you they leave behind a small trace of human life. It's how we know we're still alive.,2

2272,Ocean Vuong,"Because the thing about beauty is that it's only beautiful outside of itself. Seen through a mirror, I viewed my body as another, a boy a few feet away, his expression unmoved, daring the skin to remain as it was, as if the sun, setting, was not already elsewhere, was not in Ohio.",4

2276,Ta-Nehisi Coates,"I was learning the craft of poetry, which really was an intensive version of what my mother had taught me all those years ago--the craft of writing as the art of thinking. Poetry aims for an economy of truth--loose and useless words must be discarded, and I found that these loose and useless words were not separate from loose and useless thoughts.",2
2277,Ta-Nehisi Coates,"I began to feel that something more than a national trophy case was needed if I was to be truly free... My history professors thought nothing of telling me that my search for myth was doomed, that the stories I wanted to tell myself could not be matched to truths.",4

2281,Ta-Nehisi Coates,"I was young and love to me was a fuse that was lit, not a garden that was grown.",3
2282,Ta-Nehisi Coates,"What I am telling you is that you do not need to know to love, and it is right that you feel it all in any moment. And it is right that you see it through--that you are amazed, then curious, then belligerent, then heartbroken, then numb. You have the right to all of it.",2

2287,Rachel Carson,"The aim of science is to discover and illuminate truth. And that, I take it, is the aim of literature, whether biography or history or fiction. It seems to me, then, that there can be no separate literature of science.",2
2288,Rachel Carson,"The winds, the sea, and the moving tides are what they are. If there is wonder and beauty and majesty in them, science will discover these qualities. If they are not there, science cannot create them. If there is poetry in my book about the sea, it is not because I deliberately put it there, but because no one could write truthfully about the sea and leave out the poetry.",2
2289,Rachel Carson,Even in the vast and mysterious reaches of the sea we are brought back to the fundamental truth that nothing lives to itself.,2
2290,Rachel Carson,"This notion that 'science' is something that belongs in a separate compartment of its own, apart from everyday life, is one that I should like to challenge. We live in a scientific age; yet we assume that knowledge of science is the prerogative of only a small number of human beings, isolated and priest-like in their laboratories. This is not true. It cannot be true. The materials of science are the materials of life itself. Science is part of the reality of living; it is the what, the how, and the why of everything in our experience.",2
2291,Rachel Carson,"Once the emotions have been aroused--a sense of the beautiful, the excitement of the new and the unknown, a feeling of sympathy, pity, admiration or love--then we wish for knowledge about the subject of our emotional response.",3

2294,Rachel Carson,Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.,2
2295,Rachel Carson,It is a wholesome and necessary thing for us to turn again to the earth and in the contemplation of her beauties to know the sense of wonder and humility.,2
2296,Rachel Carson,Drink in the beauty and wonder at the meaning of what you see.,2
2297,Rachel Carson,One way to open your eyes to unnoticed beauty is to ask yourself: What if I had never seen this before? What if I knew I would never see it again?,2
2298,Rachel Carson,I believe natural beauty has a necessary place in the spiritual development of any individual or any society.,2
2299,Greta Thunberg,"I often talk to people who say, 'No, we have to be hopeful and to inspire each other, and we can't tell [people] too many negative things'... But, no -- we have to tell it like it is. Because if there are no positive things to tell, then what should we do, should we spread false hope? We can't do that, we have to tell the truth.",3
2300,Greta Thunberg,Some people say that the climate crisis is something we have all created. But that is just another convenient lie. Because if everyone is guilty then no one is to blame.,5
2301,Greta Thunberg,You say nothing in life is black or white. But that is a lie. A very dangerous lie. Either we prevent 1.5 degree [Celsius] of warming or we don't. Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control or we don't. Either we choose to go on as a civilisation or we don't. That is as black or white as it gets. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival.,4

2310,Ada Lovelace,"The science of operations, as derived from mathematics more especially, is a science of itself, and has its own abstract truth and value.",2
2311,Ada Lovelace,"The intellectual, the moral, the religious seem to me all naturally bound up and interlinked together in one great and harmonious whole... That God is one, and that all the works and the feelings He has called into existence are ONE; this is a truth... not in my opinion developed to the apprehension of most people in its really deep and unfathomable meaning.",6
2312,Ada Lovelace,The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.,4
2313,Ada Lovelace,"Imagination is the Discovering Faculty, pre-eminently... It is that which feels & discovers what is, the REAL which we see not, which exists not for our senses... Mathematical science shows what is. It is the language of unseen relations between things... Imagination too shows what is... Hence she is or should be especially cultivated by the truly Scientific, those who wish to enter into the worlds around us!",2

2317,Ada Lovelace,We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.,2
